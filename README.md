# pythonhotelproject

## Setting-up IDE with Project
1. PyCharm - Create Project. - choose location (for example: D:\DEVELOPMENT\Python\workspace\GIThubPythonProject).
2. Run (git bash?) and go to created directory (for example: cd D:\DEVELOPMENT\Python\workspace\GIThubPythonProject).
3. Enter copy command (for example: git clone git@github.com:mateuszkawa/pythonhotelproject.git).
4. Change focus to PyCharm, View -> Tool Windows -> Project (Alt + 1). Now everything should be fine.

## Start
Just run webapp.py. After this we just have to launch [localhost on port 8090/hotel](http://localhost:8090/hotel) to see 1st sample page.

## Python
First of all we should get the same python version (as I understood some of us will use Windows). That's why we should all have python 3.5.2.

## IDE
Let's use PyCharm Community Edition:

## Additional installation
In order to start We need several additional python libraries:

1. Tornado - simply start use pip:
  - Start a cmd as an Administrator.
  - 'pip install tornado'
2. Mako - like in Tornado:
  - Start a cmd as an Administrator.
  - 'pip install Mako'
3. Database Connector - this is something that we should discuss. My proposal is to use PostgreSQL.
