# Python
First of all we should get the same python version (as I understood some of us will use Windows). That's why we should all have python 3.5.2.
Download from: https://www.python.org/

# IDE
Let's use PyCharm Community Edition:

# Additional installation
In order to start We need several additional python libraries:
1. Tornado - simply start use pip:
    - Start a cmd as an Administrator.
    - 'pip install tornado'
2. Mako - like in Tornado:
    - Start a cmd as an Administrator.
    - 'pip install Mako'
3. Database Connector - this is something that we should discuss. My proposal is to use PostgreSQL.
